		<h1>The complete timeline of the 12VHPWR connector</h1>
		<h3>To make sure everyone is on the same page, lets make sure everyone understands the connector, and the specifications mentionning it. The 12VHPWR connector is part of the PCIe CEM 5.0 specification, designed by PCI-SIG. The ATX 3.0 specification is designed by Intel and gives guidelines to Power supply makers.</h3>
		<h3>Intel did not create the 12VHPWR connector. Intel just "encapsulated" the PCIe CEM 5.0 spec into the ATX 3.0 spec. The goal of all this is to create a spec where the power supply (or PSU) can tell the graphics card (or any PCIe add-in card that is ATX 3.0 compliant) how strong it is. This allows the GPU or Add-in card to adjust their max power draw depending on the PSU to not overload it.</h3>
		<h3>On paper, the idea is actually good. You would no longer get computer shutdowns from overloading, the GPU would just throttle itself instead. You get worse performance instead of... No performance at all (which is a win in my book).</h3>
		<h3>The full ATX 3.0 specification is public on Intel's website. The PCIe CEM 5.0 is not.</h3>
		<br>
		<p>_The new 12VHPWR is a single connector rated at 55A total, 9.2A per 12v pin (<a href="https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/ipla/software-development-platforms/client/platforms/alder-lake-desktop/atx-version-3-0-multi-rail-desktop-platform-power-supply-design-guide/2.0/pci-express-pcie-add-in-card-connectors-recommended/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>).</p>
		<p>_The PCIe CEM 5.0 specification now officializes power excursions (aka power spikes) and Add-in cards with a TDP over 300w (<a href="https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/ipla/software-development-platforms/client/platforms/alder-lake-desktop/atx-version-3-0-multi-rail-desktop-platform-power-supply-design-guide/2.0/pcie-add-in-card-and-psu-power-budgets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>).</p>
		<p>-The PCIe CEM 5.0 is for power. It is different from the usual PCIe specification most know for communication between CPU, GPU, motherboards, and other PCIe devices.

					<p>The german youtuber and hardware enthusiast speaks his mind about the issues he encounters with the connector since its first use on the RTX 4090. Roman blames the lack of overhead and safety margin on the connector, and lack of redundancy because of a single connector. He calls it a "garbage solution" and calls for Nvidia to start using 2 of those for very high power GPUs like the 4090.</p>
