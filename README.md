# The complete timeline of the 12VHPWR connector

Everything about the new and controversial connector dated and sourced as best as possible.

Link to the github page : https://aorph.github.io/12vhpwr/

As reminders again :

_ this new connector was developped by the PCI-SIG, not by Intel.

_ATX 3.0 and PCIe CEM 5.0 are two different things.

_ Here is the full specifications of the ATX 12V 3.0 and 3.1 from Intel :

_Nvidia's Ada Lovelace GPUs (AKA RTX 40 series cards) ___do not require ATX 3.0 or PCIe CEM 5.0 at all___. Only a 12VHPWR connector. They are fully capable of running on older ATX power supplies.
